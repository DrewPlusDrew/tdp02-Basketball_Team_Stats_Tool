# Basketball Stats Tool

## Why this project exists
This project is a demonstration of the skills learned in Treehouse Python Web Development TechDegree Unit 02, focusing on collections.

## What it does
This script imports data about fictional basketball players from another file (constants.py), then cleans that data into a more useable format.

Once cleaning is complete, the program sorts the players evenly onto one of three different teams, balancing on total number of numbers and number of experienced players.

After this initial processing is complete, the script shows the user a menu and allows them to choose a team to display statistics about. The user chooses a team, then the script calculates (if needed) and displays the following facts about the team:
  * Total players
  * List of players on the team
  * Number of experienced players on the team
  * Number of inexperienced players on the team
  * Average height of players on the team
  * Guardians (i.e. parents) of the players on the team

## How to run it
Save the files app.py and constants.py to the same directory on your machine, and then run app.py in Python 3.6 or higher. In macOS, for example, do:
`python3 ~/Documents/PythonPrograms/app.py`

Then follow the on-screen prompts and instructions.
